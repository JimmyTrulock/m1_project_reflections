You will need to copy this markdown, create your own **private** gist, and paste this markdown in your own gist. After each project, you will take time to come back to your private gist and answer each of the questions that are outlined for you below. 

# M1 Project Reflections

## Warmup Project 

### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used:
1.
2.
3.
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:

### Reflection Questions: 
**1. How do you approach solving something when you don’t have all the information?**<br />
**2. What was your most effective strategy for getting through blockers during this project? How did this help your process?**<br />
**3. Tell us about a time that you found yourself in an unproductive struggle, how did you get out of it?**<br />
**4. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?**<br />

## First Solo

### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used:
1. google
2. ruby docs
3. questions asked in the slack
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:
creats a linked list with nodes that can be minipulated through methods. It then can return a say camand to speak the data in the terminal.

### Reflection Questions: 
**1. Pick 1 technical concept you used for this project (look back at our lessons and the learning goals of the project to pick this). Explain what this concept is, how it works, and give an example of where you used this in your code.**<br />
Testing was an intresting concept to tackle. At first I struggled with it, but through repetition I've picked it up. testing lets us test the code in the system, how a user might come accross the data. The testing requiers a describe do and an it do. We next feed the info inot the test such as x = Class.new(data). Finally we have an expect line to check and see if x is indeed an inctance of the Class. For example, I tested the Node class by creating the variable node_1 then fed it through the expect(node_1) to be an instance of (Node) and the system returned a pass.

**2. What was your process when you got stuck?**<br />
walk away. several times I got stuck and steping away to do something else to get the mind off the problem really helped.
**3. If you had to do this project again, what would you do differently and why?**<br />
I'd ask more questions, the ending was a little unclear to me so I would ask about that.

## Second Solo

### Project Overview
1.Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

Process was to read the errors one by one and fix them.

2.What was hard about working with code you did not write? 

Trying to decipher what was trying to be done with the code by the previous coder.

3.What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly? 

I thought I would struggle more with reading it, but I was able to mostly understand it at a glance.

#### List out the tools you used:
1.google
2.ruby docs
3. class mates
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:
it creats DMV facilities and vehicles for verious services.

**2. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?**<br />

Helped plan out how I wouuld write my code.

**3. What was a resource that you used during this project and how did you use this to move your project forward?**<br />

Google really helped by answering some questions on how I could dig into hashes.
